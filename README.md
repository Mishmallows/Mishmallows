My name is Mishka. I made a GitHub account a while ago and forgot about it (classic). But now I’m back and actually excited to learn how it works, especially since I’ve been using Microsoft-powered tools like Copilot and GitHub for school and org stuff. I’ve even built an equipment reservation system for our Junior Marketing Association organization, and I’m always looking for ways to make things more efficient, creative, and fun. Marketing meets tech? I’m here for it.
